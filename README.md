# Bagging-Model-Random-Forest

## Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):
1. Bagging is an ensemble learning technique that involves creating multiple subsets of the original training dataset through bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement).
2. Each subset is used to train a separate instance of the same model, and their predictions are combined (e.g., averaged for regression or majority vote for classification) to make the final prediction.
3. Bagging **reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting by combining the strengths of different models trained on diverse data**.

## Random Forest:
1. Random Forest is an extension of the Bagging technique, specifically applied to decision trees.
2. It creates an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on a different bootstrapped subset of the data and with a random subset of features considered for each split.
3. The final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest reduces overfitting, increases model robustness, and maintains the interpretability of decision trees while improving predictive accuracy.

In summary, Bagging is a general ensemble method that combines predictions from multiple models trained on bootstrapped data subsets, while Random Forest is a specific implementation of Bagging that focuses on decision trees, using randomization to further enhance model diversity and performance. Both techniques are effective at reducing overfitting and improving the stability and accuracy of machine learning models.
